    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>For all of the fry Masters, like my bro BoBo. Make these and prosper.</p>

        <p>Don't skip steps, or you'll end up with raw potatoes</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>800 grams waxy potatoes </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil </li>
            <li>salt to taste </li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Peel the potatoes and cut them into long, 8 mm thick French fries. 
                (You can use a French fry cutter for this.)</li>
            <li>Soak the fries in water for at least 30 minutes. Drain them 
                thoroughly, then pat them dry with kitchen paper.</li>
            <li>Heat the Airfryer to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Put the fries in a large bowl, drizzle with the oil and toss to coat 
                them. Transfer them to the Airfryer basket. Slide the basket into the
                 Airfryer and set the timer for 18 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the timer rings, slide out the basket and shake the fries. 
                Adjust the temperature to 180C and set the timer for another 12 minutes.</li>
            <li>After 6 minutes, slide out the basket and shake the fries again.</li>
            <li>Fry until the timer rings and the fries are golden brown. 
                Sprinkle with salt and serve on a platter.</li>
        
        </ol>
